# SDL3 Template
This is my template for building SDL3 projects. See `make.sh` for build instructions on Web and Linux platforms. Other targets not presently supported.

## Graphics
The GPU can only be accessed using OpenGLES 3.0 for compatibility with web targets. A loader for this version is pre-generated by Glad and checked into the repository.
